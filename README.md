# Sine
A ground-up redesign of Soundcloud catered to heavy listeners rather than uploaders. Sine brings sorting and fast searching to all lists of music from tracks and favorites to playlists and followers.

Currently this repo is missing comments and solid organization. A large update in December will come with all the important open source necessecities.
